Dr. Gordon is particularly interested in identifying sex-specific responses to resource stress in primates, including fossil hominins.  In addition, he is broadly interested in methodological questions related to analyzing variation in incomplete datasets such as those typically associated with fossil and zooarchaeological settings, and has developed new techniques for comparative statistical analysis of hominin fossil and extant primate data.","onlineCV":"https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/GordonCV.pdf","institutePage":"https://www.albany.edu/anthropology/faculty/adam-d-gordon#","researchGate":"","googleScholar":"","otherlink":"https://www.albany.edu/~ag856732/","photo":"Gordon_Adam.jpg","projects":[]},{"title":"Chair","organization":"SUNY Upstate","level1":"Upstate Public Health Program","level2":"Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine","lastName":"Morley","firstName":"Christopher","email":"MorleyCP@upstate.edu","phone":"315-464-1700","researchInterests":"Primary Care; Public Health; Mental Health; Medical Education/Health Workforce; Disparities/Social Determinants","researchDescription":"Dr. Morley is the Chair of the Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at SUNY Upstate Medical University, as well as the Vice Chair for Research in the Department of Family Medicine.

examines the relationships between obesity and cardiovascular diseases, such as, hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD), at the molecular level; specifically the role of leptin in the regulation of cardiovascular functions. His prior studies have established the activation of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway as an essential component in maintaining the autocrine loop of the local tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during cardiac hypertrophy. He has further observed that the STAT proteins that are essential to maintain the autocrine loop of the heart tissue RAS are also the target of leptin. This observation along with the evidence on the presence of leptin receptors in the cardiovascular tissues prompted additional studies to examine leptin as a potential regulator of the RAS and/or the cardiovascular function. In the areas of cancer research, the goal of the proposed research is to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the negative regulation by Hexim1 on the leptin-Jak2 axis network during the progression of colorectal cancer  in patients carrying components of the metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.","onlineCV":"","institutePage":"","researchGate":"","googleScholar":"","otherlink":"","photo":"Mascareno_Eduardo.jpg","projects":[]},{"title":"Assistant Professor","organization":"SUNY Downstate","level1":"College of Medicine","level2":"Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences","lastName":"Meyers","firstName":"Jacquelyn","email":"Jacquelyn.Meyers@downstate.edu","phone":"","researchInterests":"N/A","researchDescription":"In the department of Psychiatry at SUNY Downstate, she currently leads a program of research examining genetic and psycho-social risk factors (trauma and resilience) for substance use disorders and co-occurring physical health outcomes.

As a doctoral student in the Department of Human Genetics concentrating in statistical and psychiatric genetics, Dr. Bigdeli was jointly supervised by Professors Brion S. Maher (Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health) and Michael C. Neale (VIPBG), and during this time was accepted into a competitive NIDA-funded T32 training program. In 2012, after successfully defending his dissertation, entitled \"Quantitative Genetic Methods to Dissect Heterogeneity in Complex Traits\", Dr. Bigdeli transitioned to a post-doctoral position under Professors Kenneth S. Kendler and Ayman H. Fanous, and was awarded the Lindon J. Eaves Award for Excellence in Postdoctoral Research. During this time, Dr. Bigdeli joined the CONVERGE (China, Oxford and VCU Experimental Research on Genetic Epidemiology) study as lead genetic analyst; these efforts resulted in the identification of the first replicated genome- wide significant associations for major depressive disorder and a jointly first-authored publication in Nature (PMID: 26176920). Dr. Bigdeli has led several large-scale collaborative studies, including harmonization and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of clinical data for tens of thousands of cases from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia Working Group, and a trans-ancestry mega-analysis of European and Han Chinese studies of major depressive disorder (PMID: 28350396). At SUNY Downstate, he supervises statistical genetic analyses of the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (GPC), a large and cosmopolitan clinical cohort of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder cases, their family members, and screened controls, with significant representation of African-ancestry and Latino populations. The major focus of Dr. Bigdeli's research continues to be the integrative analysis of measured genomic and environmental risk factors influencing risk and clinical presentation of common, multifactorial traits and diseases in diverse human populations. He will assist both projects 1 and 2 with all the genomic statistical designs, analysis, interpretation and preparation of manuscripts.","onlineCV":"","institutePage":"","researchGate":"","googleScholar":"","otherlink":"","photo":"Bigdeli_Tim.jpg","projects":[]},{"title":"Service Professor and Director","organization":"SUNY Downstate","level1":"College of Medicine","level2":"Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences","lastName":"Cohen","firstName":"Carl","email":"ccohen@downstate.edu","phone":"","researchInterests":"N/A","researchDescription":"","onlineCV":"","institutePage":"http://www.downstate.edu/psychiatry/faculty/cohen.html#","researchGate":"","googleScholar":"","otherlink":"","photo":"Cohen_Carl.jpg","projects":[]},{"title":"Assistant Professor","organization":"SUNY Downstate","level1":"College of Medicine","level2":"Physical Therapy","lastName":"Griffin","firstName":"Angela","email":"angela.griffin@downstate.edu","phone":"518-402-7962","researchInterests":"N/A","researchDescription":"​Decreased Physical Activity, Diabetes with middle-aged women, Obesity, Ways to Change Behaviors with At Risk Minority Groups, Using Technology to promote health behaviors","onlineCV":"","institutePage":"http://www.downstate.edu/CHRP/pt/faculty/griffin.html#","researchGate":"","googleScholar":"","otherlink":"","photo":"Griffin_Angela.jpg","projects":[]},{"title":"Professor","organization":"SUNY Downstate","level1":"College of Medicine","level2":"Nephrology/ Medicine","lastName":"Gruessner","firstName":"Angelika","email":"Angelika.gruessner@downstate.edu","phone":"","researchInterests":"N/A","researchDescription":"Surgery Transplantation Organ Transplantation Pancreas Transplantation Pancreatic Islet Transplantation","onlineCV":"","institutePage":"","researchGate":"","googleScholar":"","otherlink":"","photo":"Gruessner_Angelika.jpg","projects":[]},{"title":"Clinical Psychologist","organization":"SUNY Downstate","level1":"College of Medicine","level2":"Psychology","lastName":"Pencille","firstName":"Melissa","email":"Melissa.Pencille@downstate.edu","phone":"","researchInterests":"N/A","researchDescription":"","onlineCV":"","institutePage":"","researchGate":"","googleScholar":"","otherlink":"","photo":"","projects":[]},{"title":"Dean, Professor","organization":"SUNY Downstate","level1":"College of Nursing","level2":"College of Nursing","lastName":"Escallier","firstName":"Lori","email":"Lori.Escallier@downstate.edu","phone":"","researchInterests":"N/A","researchDescription":"Dr. Escallier worked at Stony Brook prior to assuming her role at Downstate.

The study takes a place-based approach to examine to what extent East Asian international students and East Asian American students report similar treatment as racialized foreigners in different urban campus settings and if this is prompting them to strategically readapt their ethnic and/or national identities around new boundaries of belonging. The multi-disciplinary teams will employ a mixed-methods, multi-level place-based approach to understand the adaptation and psychological well-being of Asian/ American students in high-immigration and low-immigration campuses in New York State.
