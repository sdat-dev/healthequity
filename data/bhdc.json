The partnership was committed to reducing health disparities in Brooklyn and increasing the level of engagement of academics, community members, and policy makers in the process. The Centerâ€™s inception was the result of recommendations of the \"Milano Report\" made to the Brooklyn Borough President in 2003."}]
