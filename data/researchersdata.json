In her research, she uses complex systems approaches to investigate the social and structural factors that influence disparities in mental health and exposure to violence.  Her current research projects include the development of an agent-based model to simulate interventions aimed at preventing violence transmission across different types of social relationships (e.g., from parent to child, between romantic partners, between peers) at different stages of the life course, and a pilot study of the mental health impact of COVID-19 on caregivers of school-age children in New York State (NYS).  She is also currently leading evaluation projects for NYS agencies, including suicide prevention efforts by the NYS Office of Mental Health and the SNUG Social Work Initiative overseen by the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services.","Q43_4":"","Q43_9":"https://www.albany.edu/sph/faculty/melissa-tracy","Q43_10":"","Q43_11":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=OIs1GSkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AJsN-F57gwMZaz3wCm5lq0s6uIq0y-NHESjrJ_PsoCprLEa7pYY-oKX_ibnIti2JR03bV1l39kZEVXN7piXJiGI8lqXIhk9qmgY76tRqP6ER_NBNJq9Dhy8","Q43_12":"","Q44_Id":"F_3gRaU1r8MwyxAmT","Q44_Name":"Tracy_headshot_2020.jpg","Q44_Size":28960,"Q44_Type":"image/jpeg","Q51_1":"COvid-19 Affecting CHildren and caregivers in New York (COACH-NY) pilot study","Q51_14":"Targeting biological, behavioral, and social processes to prevent violence in social networks","Q51_15":"Evaluation of the SNUG Social Work Initiative","Q51_16":"New Yorkers Advancing Suicide Safer Care for Youth (NYASSC for Youth)","Q51_17":"Tracking the social, psychological, and economic implications of COVID-19 among SUNY students and families","Q52_1":"","Q52_14":"","Q52_15":"","Q52_16":"","Q52_17":"","Q61":"","Q62":"","Q63_Id":"","Q63_Name":"","Q63_Size":"","Q63_Type":"","Q64":"","Q65":"","Q66":"","Q67":"","Q68":"","Q69":"","Q610_1":"","Q610_2":"","Q610_3":"","Q610_5":"","Q71":"","Q72":"","Q73":"","Q74":"","Q75":"","Q81":"","Q82":""}]
